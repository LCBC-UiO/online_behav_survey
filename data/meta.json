      "Running online behavioural data collection that collects time series data is important in several social and medical science fields. Response and response times collected in relation to stimulus shown in a specified way is a crucial instrument to such fields.\n\n\n",
      "Currently, such data is collected through external services that are run on either US or European servers, outside a Norwegian legal context. While many collect data on these anonymously, the providers claim these are truly anonymous, but the end-users (scientists) have no insight into whether these claims are true.\n\n\n",
      "Furthermore, many also need to collect this sort of data in a non-anonymous form, to connect the data to previous or existing data from the same participant. No external service can provide this alternative in a secure way that is compliant with current data security legal framework.  \n\n\n",
      "unknown element class",
      "USIT is in a great position to be able to provide such a tool, either through integration with their existing Nettskjema survey tool or as another stand-alone service connected to other USIT services. In an ideal world, having an instance where a scientist can set up experiments (for simplicity for web-application, we will focus on javascript experiments) that could send data to EduCloud or TSD, would provide a valuable and secure way of collecting such data.\n\n\n",
      "This type of service would provide a legal framework for not only green to red data, but even black data through TSD integration. \n\n\n",
      "unknown element class",
      "Attempts to talk to USIT about development of such a tool has not to date been fruitful, mainly because the use-case is not well-understood, but also because they do not know how many would be interested in this service.\n\n\n",
      "Any researcher using tools like Qualtrics, Pavlovia, Gorilla etc, or who generally collect computerised timeseries data locally that could be interested in online collection,  are welcome to answer this survey. The intention is to get some traction with USIT by showing how many would acutally want to use or try using such a service.\n\n\n",

      "We&#39;d like to know a little about you, so we can keep you updated about the process of this, and also provide USIT with some context. If you do not provide an email address, we will not be able to update you on the progress of this request to USIT.\n\n\n",
