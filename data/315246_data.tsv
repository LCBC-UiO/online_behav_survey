315246	25625962	In Promenta, we now always include funding for data management in the applications. We will also have data-management staff on permanent bases. But I will think that such a person will not have all neccessary knowledge, thus we need cooperation across research groups. We also need such support for researchers who are not part of large research groups.	sv	data-flow;fair;help-navigating;help-using;reproducible	yes	Large questionnaire studies: Ethical issues, practical issues with nettskjema, logical issues with nettskjema, how to send out many invitations, system for communications with participants, TSD access logic with multiple people needing assess to different data, sharing of syntaxes, automation of data quality control, what when there are multiple versions of questionnaires, automation of feedback to participants.Large registry study combined with new questionnaire data. Just starting now, and do not even know all issues which will arise.	PSI, Promenta	Dagfinn BergsagerNettskjema supportTSD support	much	yes	6
315246	25616536	I have the feeling that for me and my colleagues there is often the need to consult a statistician to help and guide us which statistical analysis is appropriate to use or could be done. This seems to be a very valuable resource for many I know, independently where they work or what kind of data they work with.	hf	data-processing;fair;help-navigating;learning;new-methods;reproducible	yes	Help with signal processing and especially statistical analysis of human behavioral data, EEG data and sEEG patient data (What should be done with the data).Help with how to use the computing cluster for heavy analysis.Help with acquiring skills with new tools/software/toolboxes to apply statistical analysis or signal processing, e.g. R or Python via workshops. (How to handle the data)Help in how to openly share human behavioral, EEG data and analysis scripts.	RITMO, IMV	My Colleagues	some	yes	2
315246	25612416	The final question needs an option about funds. You can only write in this kind of funds for large project grants, and not many of us get those. The smaller grants that keep many of us afloat do not have this option.	sv	data-flow;data-processing;fair;help-navigating;help-using;learning;new-methods;reproducible	possibly	NA	MAKS	mainly colleagues, other reserachers.

315246	25609782	A lot of information dissemination on what is available for resources is faculty and department specific. It is hard to know what there is and who knows what. Something simple like a flow chart might be helpful. However, knowing what researchers actually understand about FAIR data and open science is hard, even with me around to help. Hi Mo, we can talk outside this survey if it is helpful.	hf	data-flow;data-processing;fair;help-navigating;help-using;learning;new-methods;reproducible	yes	Everything, but here is one example.We need pathways for data generated across a multitude of technology can be transferred to a safe location and processed with ease. Right now our researchers are using work arounds since the safe locations are not always reliable to use. For example, collaborating across multiple universities with private but not sensitive, Educloud might be great except right now it cannot be used with custom software and there are slow down problems that are the same with our VDI. Also how to handle copyright material and the intersection of media and research. For example, media generation as part of the research project but not the actual project.	RITMO	The vendor a little but mostly from coworkersI also get help from the legal team about copyright as needed. But a lot of that we are doing for the first time so are making the best choice we can with the information at hand.	some	yes	6
315246	25609720	Depending on the project, but having someone along on the team already at the planning stage would be very good. Like any other planning of projects.	sv	data-flow;data-processing;reproducible	possibly	I currently do everything myself. While it works, it could be more professional.
