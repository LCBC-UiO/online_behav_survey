314876	25711358	lcbc	yes	8	0	The RAs work with data everyday, from samtykker, MRI to MiniCity on a computer, and these tasks are very basic \"computer wise\". I don't think this \"human/computer\" pipeline is optimized and it has roome for improvement. Together with the question above, I think we could make the RA staff for efficient if we figured out things togehter. I know that these questions might be boring and too \"basic\" for you, but it could make the data collection smoother.	The RAs would benefit from your knowledge on both data management and the research we do here at LCBC already from the beginning when they start here as RAs. Just to mention something; we had a lot of trouble with \"session\" vs. \"wave\" last year, and I think that increased knowledge about the research process among the RAs would result in less errors. To know how important it is to write correct things in a MRI-log or cognitive test to not disturb the processing pipeline, would be a thing to prioritize with the RAs and data management.	ra	They have an overview of the data flow that is extremely valuable, and the RAs needs to benefit from this. In addition, they know what would work and what they have tried before, so we can save a lot of time when discussing and solving problems together. The things you do to make it easier for us are always extremely appreciated - from emptying hard drives, setting up MRI-protocols, and simplifying nettskjemas.	Tasks to create a better workflow for the data collection. To access the services we need to do our job, or to improve things we use on a daily basis.	We often need a confirmation from you guys if we did something or make something to use in the data collection, so this could be nettskjemas, TSD-questions, and the general pipeline of data collection.	At the RA office we control the data we collect, and in that pipeline, there's a lot of manual checking and excel-sheets which could be automated. We have a lot of nice services to help us with this, but there are still some \"holes\" in the pipeline which makes it necessary to check things. This relates mainly to the cognitive tests and behavioral data.

314876	25590682	lcbc	yes	10	0	NA	My impression is that the technical staff have lots of work on nearly all of the time. They are effective in their work. If I need help, they are typically more than willing and offer efficient support. They are critical for the day-to-day running of the center, and are constantly improving workflows to make things more efficient.	postdoc	It can't be overstated how critical the work of the technical staff is to LCBC. In particular, database management, preprocessing pipelines and their development, development of useful tools that improve research workflows, both for researchers in-house, and the neuroimaging community across the world (e.g. developing packages like \"ggseg\"). We all benefit immensely from their work.	General trouble shooting. Coding help in R/bash/python. Data locations. Data extraction.

314876	25588514	lcbc	yes	7	7	More time to sit down and do some of the things we ask for, but thats in an ideal world this would always be the case.	I feel some of the things I need help with always if to Mo, which has alot on her plate. For datacollection point of view it would be easier to ask for something if there were a person more helping out on the more simpler questions. Feel often bad asking, as I now she is overloaded with a lot of other tasks, and some of the task are often not so big, so if there was another person that worked more on the simpler stuff in relation to incoming data then it would be easier to ask without feeling bad about it.	admin	I have no chance doing what they are doing, so of course the work that is done in making quick scripts for making good overviews of incoming data (such as questionnaires and consents) is useful for me to do this part of my job quicker.	A lot of task related to datacollection in general; TSD help in checking incoming data, ethical questions, recruitment of new staff, recruitment/helping with booking of participants, make updated manuals etc	Organisation of TSD in relation to checking data and clean up there, setting up nettskjema, help organizing \"bemanning\" for datacollection (before this was sorted within the RA-group itself, but now I am in charge of it often, but ask help from the RAÂ´s as they know best who can when).	Setting up new forms for datacollection in nettskjema could go faster if we had the capacity for it (now only Mo that is mainly in charge of this as this have to be finalized by her, but she have a lot on her plate, so it often stops a bit there due to the heavy workload she has) and also sometimes when things need to be fixed of scripts in TSD for same reason.
