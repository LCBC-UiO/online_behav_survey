      "Capturing and processing large data sets is becoming increasingly important in social sciences and humanities, but project leaders can struggle with implementing the necessary technical solutions to deal with increasing demands on open and reproducible science.  For instance, working open source software like Python and R, using version control like git and GitHub, using Open Science Framework, using parallell computing on Sigma2/TSD, using TSD efficiently, structuring data according to FAIR principles etc.\n\nThese increasing demands from funders and instutitions to implement new ways of working that requires technical solutions are taxing for researcers that want to focus on the science and not dealing with new tools.\n",
      "Researchers often need help in setting up systems to get their projects off on the right track, and the earlier this can be done, the more likely a project is to meet its deliverables. But it is not realistic to expect every researcher to have the skillset needed to meet the increasing demands on technical solutions. Having the ability to utilise specialised staff, with experience and expertise in utilising a variety of technical solutions for open and reproducible science, will enable researchers to focus on the research. \n",
      "Furthermore, most projects only have this need in the beginning  (and maybe at the end) of a project, making it difficult to justify setting aside budgets to hire staff to do the work. So far, only large and established labs and centers with stable external funding are able to employ such staff on fulltime basis.\n",
      "We, a group of data scientists currently associated with LCBC and Promenta, believe a new model of organising this type of workforce is a necessity at UiO in today&#39;s research landscape. We are thus considering establishing a core facility dedicated to assist UiO researchers in the capture, structuring and processing of complex life science data. For this reorganisation to occur, it would be beneficial for us to know how many, to which extent, and for what types of tasks researchers need this type of help. We would greatly appreciate any feedback and thoughts on this from our colleagues.\n",
